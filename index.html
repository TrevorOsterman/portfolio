        <h1>Allow me to introduce myself...</h1>
          <p>Currently enrolled in Thinkful's Fullstack Flex program and been actively working on my education in web development since late 2018. Graduated with honors from Arizona State University's school of philosophy in 2012, and I've been looking for my next big challenge since then. What I love in philosophy is creating clean, effective arguments that serve a purpose, so I'm naturally drawn to the critical-thinking and problem-solving involved with web development.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Beyond any educational and professional endeavors, I'm also a lifelong, self-taught musician that enjoys coming up with clever ways to actualize the sounds I have in my head. My education in music has taught me that there are many different and creative ways to approach whatever challenges you are presented with, and I'm enjoying figuring out how that translates into web development.</p>

          <h1>Here are some things I've done:</h1>
            <h2><i>Little Quiz of Horrors</i></h2>
              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/NYE0vUN.png" id="horrorthumb" alt="little-quiz-of-horrors-thumb">
              <p>A simple, 10-question quiz on some of the most iconic horror films in history. The point of this project was to focus on the use of jQuery to render the form element within the DOM to house the questions asked throughout the quiz, as opposed to having all 10 questions rendered out as soon as the page loads.</p>
